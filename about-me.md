## Why statistics?
I chose statistics as my undergraduate major a bit on a whim, but I grew to like it. My favorite thing about statistics is used to investigate questions. I'm sure you'll see plenty of examples throughout class, but my favorites are definitely business, biotech, and basketball. Though we go over coins and pulling balls out of urns in class a lot, do know that the applications are super broad!

## A little about me
I'm Edie, and I'm your faithful STAT2 GSI. I'm a 2nd year biostatistics masters student. I got my Bachelor's in statistics from Davis. Iâ€™m one half academic instructor (for you) and one half athletic instructor (for my karate students), and my two sides unavoidably mesh together. I will always try my best to give you what you need as students; I aim to be your faithful academic plug. I apologize in advance for my overanimated facial expressions, my graduate student fatigue, and my humor. I love teaching though, and hope you do well in the course.
